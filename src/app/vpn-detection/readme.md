# VPN Detection and Location Spoofing Protection

In this use case demo, we use Fingerprint [VPN Detection](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/smart-signals-overview#vpn-detection-for-browsers) to detect visitors trying to spoof their location.

- The core of the use case is implemented in this [component](./VpnDetectionUseCase.tsx) and this [endpoint](./api/activate-ppp/route.ts).
- We are using [Sealed Client Results](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/sealed-client-results) to protect the Fingerprint integration from client-side tampering and reverse-engineering.
